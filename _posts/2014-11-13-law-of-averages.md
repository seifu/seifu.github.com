# Average uses of average


So I don't know why people write quotes of other things they like in blog posts to prove a point. I've seen people quote books like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to things written by self-made gossip celebrities like Perez Hilton. In an effort to conform to societal blogging norms I will write some quotes about average here from a wide array of sources.

Winston Churchill once said:

> The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.

Sigmund Freud refers to the normal in this quote:  
> Every normal person, in fact, is only normal on the average. His ego approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent.

Another great has shown hatred for the word average. Portia de Rossi writes: 
> Average. It was the worst, most disgusting word in the English language. Nothing meaningful or worthwhile ever came from that word.

In this post I will explore the word average from the perspective of an old enemy.
